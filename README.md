# Blue Belt - WebSocket - Hai Mai

## System Design Documents
### The link
This is the [System Design](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1CXtgp6uZtujuBJJuM7yUiyVdqg-F46Iv/view?usp=sharing).  
After clicking the link, click "Open with draw.io" to view the document fully.

### The content
The system design document contains the following:
- Logical Flow
- Component Diagram
- API Design
- Class Diagram
- Database Design  

Each of the above sections locate in a separate tab at the bottom of draw.io UI.
### It is not perfect
I am not a professional designer, so the document may not be perfect.  
However, I tried my best to make it clear and easy to understand.  
Let discuss on how we can improve it.

## The plan to implement the system design is as follows:
- [The timeline for the project](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVKrjVg9g=/?share_link_id=812507696006)

## Implementation
I choose to implement the Server component.
You can find the code in the `message_consumer` folder.

## How to run the code
The code does not run, actually. It is just a skeleton code to show the structure of the code.

## Why I choose to implement the Server component
- I am a backend developer, so the server should be my first responsibility.
- Also, I find it to be challenge. This is my very first time working with WebSocket. I am so curious about how it works.
